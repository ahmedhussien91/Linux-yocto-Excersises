# Building Raspberry pi Image

## Downloading poky and Raspberry pi meta layer

we need to download poky from [here](https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky) but first we need to identify which branch to work on

Identifying the branch to work on:

- we usually pick the LTS branch(long time support branch) as it's the branch that can have work on it and buggs can be fixed if found
- you can be forced to use other EOL branches as the vendor you are working with only support this branch 



we picked up **Dunfell** branch

```sh
# getting poky
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
git checkout Dunfell
```

  we also goto https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/ move the branch to **Dunfell** check if the raspberry pi meta layer exist:

- [meta-raspberrypi](https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/dunfell/layer/meta-raspberrypi/) exist -> checking link you can see recipes, machines, appends and classes that exist on this branch 

- download and checkout the **Dunfell** branch

  ```sh
  # getting meta-raspberrypi
  git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-raspberrypi
  git checkout Dunfell
  ```

NOTE: 

- that no one Edits poky layer 
  - as it's a common layer between multiple HW and SW vendors.  
  - you may need to update you poky to a newer version

## Go through folder structure of poky

![Screenshot from 2022-09-07 07-09-28](readme.assets/Screenshot from 2022-09-07 07-09-28.png)

**bitbake**: Holds all scripts used by the BitBake command.

**documentation**: All documentation sources for the Yocto Project documentation. you can build those to pdf documents.

**meta**: Contains the **OpenEmbedded-Core metadata**.

**meta-skeleton**: Contains **template** recipes for BSP and kernel development.

**meta-poky**: Holds the configuration for the **Poky** reference **distribution**.

**meta-yocto-bsp**: Configuration for the Yocto Project reference hardware board support package

**oe-init-build-env**: Script to set up the **OpenEmbedded build environment**.  This script has to be sourced before you start working.

**scripts**: Contain scripts used to setup the environment, development tools and tools to flash the generated images on target.

## Build Raspberrypi Linux Image

### Environement Setup

while building poky and layers like meta-raspberrypi don't change, all files generated are placed in a **build** directory.

sourcing `oe-init-build-env` script creates this **build** folder, and set some environment  variables that enable the use of  `bitbake` (PATH variable)

```sh
#source ./oe-init-build-env [builddir]
source ./oe-init-build-env # would generate folder `build` if variable wasnot passed
```

> ### Shell environment set up for builds. ###
>
> You can now run 'bitbake <target>'
>
> Common targets are:
>     core-image-minimal
>     core-image-sato
>     meta-toolchain
>     meta-ide-support
>
> You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86'
>
> Other commonly useful commands are:
>  - 'devtool' and 'recipetool' handle common recipe tasks
>  - 'bitbake-layers' handles common layer tasks
>  - 'oe-pkgdata-util' handles common target package tasks

- **core-image-minimal**: small image with command line interface
- **core-image-sato**: image with sato support. stato is a GNOME mobile-based user interface
- **meta-toolchain**: Includes development headers and libraries to develop directly on the target
- **meta-ide-support**: Generates the corss-toolchain. Useful when working with the SDK

SATO User interface:

### Configuring the build

after sourcing the script another output should be available `build` folder

![image-20220907073627136](readme.assets/image-20220907073627136.png)

`build` folder contains:

**conf**: Configuration files. Image specific and layer configuration

`build/conf` contain: 

- **bblayers.conf**: Explicitly list the available layers.
- **local.conf**: Set up the configuration variables relative to the current user for the build. Configuration variables can be overridden there.



why to set configuration inside the `build` folder ?  

​	The idea is that you can have same layers, same poky, and build with different configurations, different layers, machines, changing some variables 

[Variables link](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/variables.html)configuration variables relative to the current user for the build. Configuration variables can be overridden there.

#### bblayer.conf

we need to add vendor layer (**meta-rasbperrypi**) to the existing layers

```sh
# POKY_BBLAYERS_CONF_VERSION is increased each time build/conf/bblayers.conf
# changes incompatibly
POKY_BBLAYERS_CONF_VERSION = "2"

BBPATH = "${TOPDIR}"
BBFILES ?= ""

BBLAYERS ?= " \
  /home/ahmed/Documents/linux_amit/Embedded_linux/Linux-yocto-Excersises/yocto/building_Raspberrypi_image/poky/meta \
  /home/ahmed/Documents/linux_amit/Embedded_linux/Linux-yocto-Excersises/yocto/building_Raspberrypi_image/poky/meta-poky \
  /home/ahmed/Documents/linux_amit/Embedded_linux/Linux-yocto-Excersises/yocto/building_Raspberrypi_image/poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
  /home/ahmed/Documents/linux_amit/Embedded_linux/Linux-yocto-Excersises/yocto/building_Raspberrypi_image/meta-raspberrypi \
  "
```



#### local.conf

we need also to configure our local.conf varaibles:

**BB_NUMBER_THREADS:** How many tasks BitBake should perform in parallel. Defaults to the number of CPUs on the system. `8`

**PARALLEL_MAKE:** How many processes should be used when compiling. Defaults to the number of CPUs on the system `-j 8`

**MACHINE:** The machine the target is built for `raspberrypi2`

```sh
...
# This sets the default machine to be qemux86-64 if no other machine is selected:
#MACHINE ??= "qemux86-64"
MACHINE = "raspberrypi2"
BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "8"
PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 8"
...

```



### Building

to build our image we use bitbake

```sh
# bitbake [options] [recipename/target ...]
bitbake core-image-minimal
```

building will generate those folders:

- **downloads**: Downloaded upstream tarballs of the recipes used in the builds.

- **sstate-cache**: Shared state cache. Used by all builds

- **tmp**: Holds all the build system outputs.

under **tmp/** you can find also:

- **tmp/buildstats/**: Build statistics for all packages built (CPU usage, elapsed time, host,timestamps…).

- **tmp/deploy/**: Final output of the build.

- **tmp/deploy/images/**: Contains the complete images built by the OpenEmbedded build system. These images are used to flash the target.

- **tmp/work/**: Set of specific work directories, split by architecture. They are used to unpack, configure and build the packages. Contains the patched sources, generated objects and logs.

- **tmp/sysroots/**: Shared libraries and headers used to compile applications for the target but also for the host.



## Downloading images to target

### Preparing your SD card

we need now to flash the output image to SD card of raspberry pi, but first let's have a look at how is the raspberrypi boot sequance ?

![Screenshot from 2022-09-08 05-12-24](readme.assets/Screenshot from 2022-09-08 05-12-24.png)

goto `build/tmp/deploy/images/\<raspberrypi>/bootfiles` you will find all the files mentioned in the boot sequence diagram.

you can modify  `config.txt` to enable and disable some HW from bootloader, also `cmdline.txt` to pass arguments (parameters to kernel) 

we need to setup our SD card to have two partitions as we did before:

1- `boot` partition, formated as fat32 and have all the `bootfiles` folder + dtp files + system image

2- `rootfs`partition formated as ext4 and have the files system (actually depending on your file system format you will have to format your SD card)



```sh
# format the SD card to have two partitions
# list block devices
lsblk
# identify your block(sdb) and delete all of its partitions 
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
# make your partitions as the image below and write then quit
```

![image-20220910221002529](readme.assets/image-20220910221002529.png)

>Syncing disks.

`raspberrypi` (boot) folder must contain 

![image-20220910221559188](readme.assets/image-20220910221559188.png)

rootfs is ext3 and must contain the extracted root filesystem 

### letting Yocto prepare SD card for us

we just add to `local.conf` this line 

```sh
IMAGE_FSTYPES +="rpi-sdimg"
```

this will output a single binary file `core-image-minimal-raspberrypi2.rpi-sdimg` that can be flashed directly through the command 

```sh
sudo dd if=tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi2/core-image-minimal-raspberrypi2.rpi-sdimg of=/dev/sdb bs=1M
```





after this we have to insert the  SD card and power on Raspberry pi,  you should have linux up and running on Raspberrypi
